# slippi-combo-scripts
JavaScript Slippi scripts to create Auto-generated Super Smash Bros Melee Combo Videos

Getting Started:
To use any of these scripts, you must install the Slippi Javascript Parser. 
To install the module, execute the command:
    npm install slp-parser-js

Running the script:
Load all the files that you want to parse into the 'slp' directory, then run the script. 
Run the script by executing the command:
    node (scriptName.js)

The script will then have generated a .json file that can be executed by the Dolphin emulator to watch the combo clips.

These scripts are written in Ubuntu and are designed for use in a Lunix environment. 

Uses py-slippi version () and slp-parser-js version ().
