Slippi Combo Video Creation

Making a JSON file that contains the combos
    put all the .slp files into the local slp directory
    run the command "node getSlippiCombos.js"
        the .json file has now been created

Playing the json file in dolphin to watch the combo video. 









Possible combo of the week after each of the combos have been created by the script???
